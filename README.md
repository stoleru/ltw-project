This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created by Andrei Stoleru as a project homework for SDTW Master. This app allows a user to see notes and add notes without the need of a database. All the data is stored in `.md` files and therefore allows the user to write notes content in Markdown. 

## Getting Started

First, install the modules:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
